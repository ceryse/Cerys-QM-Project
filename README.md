Publishing my code and data to ensure reproducibility for my final written investigation. 

Input: fire incident data, MSOA boundaries and census data
Output: Multiple Linear Regression models for various socioeconomic variables and fire instances and response times.

Note: the fire data is too large to upload to Github, but can be downloaded from here: https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/london-fire-brigade-incident-records
